<br>I recently attended <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.greengaged.com" target="self">Greengaged</a>, a series of lectures and workshops at The Design Council during London Design week.  The idea was to get designers, graphic designers in particular, talking about sustainability and how designers can affect this in a positive way.  As part of the week, I was lucky enought to visit the <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.powerday.co.uk/content/view/13/33/" target="self">Powerday</a> recycling centre on the Regent's Canal in London; check out the <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.greengaged.com" target="self">photos</a> on the Greengaged blog.  The site has been recovering, sorting, recycling, reselling and sourcing new markets for London's commercial waste since 2007.  Only 5% of the waste they recieve goes straight to landfill as no markets have yet been identified.  We saw everying thing from chipboard and concrete to bath taps and roof tiles.  Get in touch as they are happy to arrange visits.

<br>The week's events were masterminded by Graphic Design Studio <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.thomasmatthews.com" target="self">Thomas Matthews</a> and <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.threetreesdontmakeaforest.org" target="self">Three Trees</a>, along with <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.redesigndesign.org" target="self">ReDesign</a> and Kingston University.  Other interesting people I met include Doug from <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.futerra.co.uk" target="self">Futerra</a>, <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.simonwinterdesign.co.uk" target="self">Simon Winter</a>, Lucy Choules from <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.chaletalpin.com" target="self">Chalet Alpin</a>and <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://foldedsheet.wordpress.com/" target="self">Foldedsheet</a> and Nick Marks from The <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.neweconomics.org" target="self">New Economics Foundation</a>.
<br>Hopefully the event will be taking place again in 2009, so keep an eye on their website.</p>
