<p>09.08 <a class="project-link" href="http://www.thedolectures.com" >The DO Lectures</a>
<br>Just got back from a weekend in West Wales at the DO Lectures and I feel very privillaged to have been there indeed.  The four days of inspiring lectures were organised and the brainchild of <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.howies.co.uk" target="self">howies</a>.  The idea is simply to inspire people to do stuff.  There was a truely diverse set of people from surfer Andy Cummins to Scientist Micheal Brangarht.  It will take a while for all the information and wise words to settle I think.  An unexpected favorite was the gingerbread and <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com" target="self">Russell Davies</a>.  I also met  <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.tomfishburne.com" target="self">Tom Fishburne</a> from <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.methodproducts.co.uk" target="self">Method</a>, who is doing some great work.
<br>All of the lectures were filmed and can be viewed online at <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.thedolectures.com" target="self">www.thedolectures.com</a>.  A huge thank you to everyone at howies and Fforest Farm.  Amazing.
<br> Dick Darserty said don't just stand there.  Do something.
<br>Worrying is like a rocking chair it gives you something to do but gets you nowhere.</p>
