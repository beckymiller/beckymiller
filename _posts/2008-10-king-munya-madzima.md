<p>10.08 <strong>King Munya Madzima</strong>
<br>I met King Munya Madizina on Brighton beach making and selling his facsinating pieces of jewelery and other creations.  Using mainly disgarded pieces of cutlery, he uses no more than a vice, a piercing saw, a hammer and the strength in his own hands to find new forms from the forks, spoons and knives.  I was particularly draw to the insects he makes; their invertibrate bodies resonate perfectly with the way he brings the metal pieces together, held only by their position relative to eachother. King has studied fine art and photography in Toronto and in his native Zimbabwe, but has been a resourceful maker since he was a child when he used barbbed wire to make toy cars.
<br>He hopes to return to his homecounty to continue his work there on Wrong Time Village, a community gallery and workshop he has set up.
<br>He is often at Camden Market in London and Brighton beach (when the weather is fine) if you want to see for yourself.
