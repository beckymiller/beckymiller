<p>02.09 <strong>Kubes d'Or</strong>
<br>One lump or two.  I stumbled on these stock cubes in the supermarket in France.  Packed into a bright little red and yellow box, each of the 16  perfectly wrapped golden bars contains 2 stock cubes, so you are never left with half a crumbly stock cube.  A thoughtful bit of design and a bit like peas in a pod.</p>
