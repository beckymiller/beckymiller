<p>13.08.09 <strong>Now Boarding at Glastonbury</strong>
<br>At Glastonbury this year Greenpeace had done a great job at turing their small field into a parallel version of Sipson village, complete with skate park, climbing wall, solar powered hot showers and a lounge bar.  They had made also a giant version of the bed of blunt nails that you can use to make a relief image of your face or hand with, from all the little silver nitrous oxide canistors.  This was particularly satisfying for me as a litter picker at the festival this year, as these devious little bottles are perfectly adapted to boring their way into the mud and also fail to comply with any of the specified recycling categories.  It looked pretty cool too and worked!
<br>On a more serious note, Sipson is the village which is earmarked by the goeverment  to disappear under concrete in favour of a third runway at Heathrow.  The deal is 2.5km of concrete and 11.7 million tonnes of CO2 annually (estimate by <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://wdm.gn.apc.org/flights-heathrows-third-runway-will-emit-same-greenhouse-gas-emissions-kenya" target="self">WDM</a>), equal to Kenya's total annual output, traded for 700 homes, 3 pubs, village shop and school.  I had heard about this on the news before but wasn't quite aware how much will be lost in order to make Heathrow the UK's biggest source of CO2.  Cunning Greenpeace have made a stealth purchased of a small piece of land right in the centre of the proposed site in order to hold a stake in the land.
