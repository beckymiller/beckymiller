<p>22.08.09 <strong>Elephant Bed</strong>
<br>I popped into Fabrica Art Gallery in Brighton on my way back to the train station this weekend and had a nice surprise.  The interior of this converted church is currently hung with paper sculptures by American artist John Grade.  Constructed from precise drawings, folded then pritt stuck together and hung in sections, these huge hollow funnels float serenely in the atrium of the church like lungs.   Coincidentally the space rather remind me of the giant lily pad glasshouse I visited only a few days ago at Kew Gardens.  Watch the <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.fabrica.org.uk/e_bed_timelapse.htm" target="self">time lapse video of the installation here</a> and more images <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.russelldavies.typepad.com" target="self">here</a>.
<br>Elephant Bed is open until the end of August and on the bank holiday Monday, volunteers will carry the paper sculptures down to the sea where they will be taken in by the water.
