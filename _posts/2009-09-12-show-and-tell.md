<p>12.09.09 <strong>Show and Tell</strong>
<br>I went along to a day of talks today going by the word 'interesting'.  And they were.  During the course of the day it began to remind me of Show and Tell which we had at primary school.  I used to really enjoy Show and Tell.  I think we also had a session more on the lines of just Tell, where you didn't have to bring anything in.  But I much prefered Show and Tell.  Age 5 or 6 years it was off course already a sort of Show Off and Tell, where people often bought in their new toys etc.  But that was still interesting and at age 5 or 6 we started to fromulate opionions about stuff in our lives.  I think Interesting was a bit like this for me.  It might have seemed a bit of a cliche geeky day, where arty types talk about sutff they find thought provoking, but I think this is a good thing.  In fact I think it is something which alot of us as we grow up loose touch with.  The theme of one of the speaker's talk, Asi, was children's drawings and how revealing they can be in terms of semiotics, emotional prefernce, social stereotypes, bought the day full circle for me.
<br>Other things I liked about the day was the bunting, tea, cakes, sunny intervals and other interesting people.
<br>Big thanks to Russell Davies who organised the event.  He is pretty interesting too. Read his blog <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://russelldavies.typepad.com/" target="self">here</a>.
