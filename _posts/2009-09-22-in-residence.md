<p>22.09.09 <strong>In Residence</strong>
<br>I have been helping out at the Design Museum office this week and been checking out the work of their new Designers in Residence for 2009-2010.  I was snapping some pictures of <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.designingthenews.com/about" target="self">Dave Bowker's</a> new wayfinding system for the museum which makes thoughtful reference to the architecture of the building, the images are <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30980611@N02/" target="self">here</a>.  Also interesting are Asif Khan's dry freezing research and plastination experiments - his latest update is <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://inresidence.designmuseum.org/updates/2009/9/15/freeze-drying.html" target="self">here</a>.</p>
