<p>05.10.09 <strong>Heart</strong>
<br>Have you visted <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.danieleatock.com/" target="self">Daniel Eatock's website</a>?  Its worth a good nose around.  Full of thoughtful and oblique  observations and experiments, it is also built using <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.indexhibit.org/history/" target="self">Indexhibit</a> which Eatock has pioneered as a community web project for promoting content focused websites.
<br>The matter of fact aesthetic of the site merged with Eatock's off beat logic is addictive.  If you're inspired by his narative you can contribute to <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.danieleatock.com/project/thank-you-photographs/" target="self">Thank You Pictures</a>.</p>
