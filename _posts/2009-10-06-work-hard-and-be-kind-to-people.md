<p>06.10.09 <strong>Work Hard and Be Kind to people</strong>
<br>The words that graphic design studio <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.imagistlondon.com/" target="self">IMAGIST</a> London work by.  I was lucky enough to do a placement with them over the summer where among other kind things they did for me, they have lent me a few books from their shelf.  I am new to the rules of graphic design and typography so I am very gratful of the chance to share their books and keep learning.
<br>A couple of other kind and forward thinking companies who understand the importance of sharing knowledge and books are <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.howies.co.uk/content.php?xSecId=10" target="self">howies</a> who also have bookshelves in their shops, and <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://72rivingtonstreet.com/library/" target="self">72 Rivington Street</a> in London, whose library I have recently joined.
<br>By the way, <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://oneredpaperclip.blogspot.com/" target="self">One Red Paperclip</a> is not a zen guide to stationary items for designers but after reading I definately want to take a leaf out of that book.</p>
