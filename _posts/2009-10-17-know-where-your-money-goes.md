<p>17.10.09 <strong>know where your money goes</strong>
<br>This is an enlightened online customer service tool bought to you by a truly radical bank.  Harnessing the framework of Google maps, <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.triodos.co.uk/knowwhereyourmoneygoes/organisation/" target="self">Triodos Bank's new online tool</a> allows you to literally see where your money goes in the world, giving you the power of judgment on your savings and investments.
<br><a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.triodos.co.uk/knowwhereyourmoneygoes/triodos-bank/" target="self">Triodos Bank</a> has recently been awarded the title of the <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.ftconferences.com/sustainablebanking" target="self">Financial Times Sustainable Bank of the Year 2009</a>, and rightly so I think.  They are pioneering a genuinely transparent model of banking, which strictly only finances companies, institutions and projects that benefit people and the environment.  This latest online tool reminds me of the ideas discussed at the <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://greengaged.com/blog/post/co-opportunity-learning-from-new-media-models/" target="self">Greengaged Cooportunity workshop day</a>. It is exciting to see that this area of thinking is already an accessible reality.</p>
