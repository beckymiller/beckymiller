<p>02.12.09 <strong>Je suis un arossoir</strong>
<br>I had read that Jasper Morrison had converted part of his studio on Kingsland Road in London into a shop, so popped in today on my way home to shelter from the rain and check it out.
<br>I was comforted to find in the far corner of the shop a familiar watering can - the same watering can I chose to use when making <a class="light-grey-link" href="arossoir1.html">Je ne suis pas un arossoir</a> two years ago; Watering Can Number 9 to be precise (pictured above).  All of the objects in Jasper Mossison's small shop have been selcted for their <em>super normal</em> quality and were formally exhibted in the <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://2021supernormal.wordpress.com/dialogue-defining-super-normal-jasper-and-naoto/" target="self">Super Normal exhibition</a> in 2007.  Only a handful of the objects are designed by Morrison, with the large magority produced by anonymous designers.  For me Super Normal acknowledges humble design optimums and serves as a highly refined reminder of why we create objects. Given the current state of the planet and it's people, this is at last, gradually becoming a serious consideration for deisgners and their consumers, who might start to feel contented.
<br>I chose Watering Can Number 9, after much thought and disucssion, as an architype watering can.  I was seeking the super normal quality that would silently engage without a word.  For this reason I was even compelled to remove the number 9 and zig zag relief and apply a bright grass green finish colour.  Maybe now I should find out a bit more on Watering Can Number 9's own  history before I go changing the story.  RESPECT YOUR ELDERS.  Watering Can Number 9 is officially super normal.</p>
