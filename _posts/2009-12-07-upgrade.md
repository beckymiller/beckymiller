<p>07.12.09 <strong>upgrade</strong>
<br>After a good deal of hunting around for a new purse I discovered a friend was already making exactly what I had been looking for with a beautiful twist.  Since the zip on my very first purse had broken I have been after a strong, simple, and ideally a leather purse.  (I have had other purses in between, but in the last year reverted to my original purse for its simplicity.)
<br>Code name <a class="light-grey-link" href="http://www.zippylovelock.co.uk/" target="self">Zippy Lovelock</a> makes beautifully thougthful purses (and bags) from old leather scraps, lined with old mens shirts and other colourful fabircs offcuts.  There is even a neat tuck in the shirt to separate a bank card from coins and protect the magnetic strip.  Whatsmore, if I break the zip I know where to go for a repair.</p>
